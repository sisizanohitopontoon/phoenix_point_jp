AI algorithms are now able to sequence Pandoran DNA with great speed and accuracy, despite the large genome size and constant mutations. All research into Pandoran creature types and mutations will proceed at a much faster pace. There is also the possibility that further research could improve our soldiers' resistance to Pandoran viruses."
