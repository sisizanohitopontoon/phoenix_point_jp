It was founded in 1945, but was preceded by a number of other organizations, such as the Committee for the Study and Prevention of Species-Level Threats (Soviet Union, 1918-1927) and the Phoenix Working Group (United States, 1935-1945). It also shares its symbol with similar groups dedicated to fighting for humanity going back all the way to the 9th century, but is not strictly speaking a continuation of those groups, except in so far as each generation picks up the torch and continues the struggle.[LF][LF]The golden age of the Phoenix Project ended in 1973 with the disastrous Phoenix-2 mission to study the Tsiolkovskiy crater on the Moon, after which the Project entered a period of slow decline. After its existence was revealed to the media and all funding was finally cut, the Phoenix Project was forced to become independent, with most of its operatives acting as sleeper agents.[LF][LF]The best-known individuals associated with the Phoenix Project are Randolph Symes Sr. (Director, 1945-1955), Newton Sumrall (Director, 1960-1968, Administrator, 1968-1974), Irina Semionova (Administrator, 1960-1968) and Randolph Symes III (Director, 2025-2047)."

Lasting until 2035, it devastated large parts of the planet and caused tens of millions of deaths. Large nations fractured, democratic governments became increasingly authoritarian, and coordinated action against the Pandoran threat became a secondary issue. Nuclear war was only averted by the intervention of the Phoenix Project."
