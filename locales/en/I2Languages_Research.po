msgstr "Our analysis of the Antediluvian texts, combined with the knowledge gathered by the Phoenix Project over the course of the last century, has forced us to acknowledge a shocking truth: the war against Earth is being waged by an alien entity. This being of unimaginable age and power is located on Yuggoth, the ninth planet of our solar system.[LF][LF]Yuggoth's orbit is highly elliptical, coming close to Earth once every 17.000 years. When it does, Yuggoth expels meteorites carrying various iterations of the Pandoravirus, a bioweapon intended to radically transform the Earth's ecosystem to the advantage of the Yuggothian Entity.[LF][LF]The Entity communicates with its creatures via some form of quasi-telepathic signal. Evidence suggests that some human beings are sensitive to these transmissions, explaining the occurence of the name \"\"Yuggoth\"\" and variations thereof in the work of artists such as H.P. Lovecraft, Virginia Gutierrez, John Bellairs, Ralph Pabodie, and many others. This presumably represents an earlier, less powerful expression of the phenomenon we have termed Oneiric Delirium.[LF][LF]We have concluded that the ultimate purpose of the Entity is to create the ecological conditions that will allow it to come to Earth, and have hypothesized the existence of the Yuggothian Receptacle, a clone or replica to which the Entity will transfer its consciousness. We believe the Pandorans are already in the process of accumulating biomass and genetic material for this purpose."

There is also the possibility that further research could improve our soldiers' resistance to Pandoran viruses."
