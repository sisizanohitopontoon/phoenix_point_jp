Arbitration; Governing Law.  [CR][LF][CR][LF]PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.[CR][LF][CR][LF]You and Snapshot will arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement and your use of the Software, except that you and Snapshot are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. [CR][LF]You and Snapshot will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Snapshot will be sent to Snapshot Games, Inc., Attn: David Kaye, 145 S Fairfax Ave #200, Los Angeles CA 90036.  You and Snapshot further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Los Angeles County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules; and that the state or federal courts in Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.  Any dispute between the parties will be governed solely by both this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  The 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement.  Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Snapshot will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.[CR][LF][CR][LF]10.        Termination. Snapshot may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, immediately upon notice to you. Snapshot may also discontinue the Service at any time, in which case this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice. You may terminate this Agreement by ceasing use of the Software and Service, cancelling any account you may have with us to use the Service (if any), and deleting all copies of the Software in your possession or control. In the event of the termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) the license granted to you in this Agreement will terminate; (b) you must immediately cease all use of the Software and Service and destroy or erase all copies of the Software in your possession or control; and (c) all sections of this Agreement except Section 2 will survive any such termination, together with the Terms of Service.[CR][LF][CR][LF][CR][LF]11.        Import and Export Control Laws.  Snapshot is subject to regulation by agencies of the United States, such as the U.S. Department of Commerce, which prohibit export of certain products or technology to certain countries or nationals of certain countries.  You will not use or otherwise export or re-export the Software except as authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Software was obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the Software may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a nation or resident of) any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List.  [CR][LF][CR][LF]12.        General. (a) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. (b) Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Snapshot, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Subject to the foregoing restriction, this Agreement will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by you, us, and each of your and our respective successors and assigns. (c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Terms of Service, sets forth our entire agreement with respect to your use of the Software or Service and the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements whether written or oral.  No amendment, modification, or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by the party to be bound thereby. (d) Language. This Agreement is in the English language, which language will be controlling, even if interpretations of this Agreement in other languages are made."

She founded her religion by uniting three pre-existing cults: the Children of the Black Tide, the Holy Disciples of the Xenoglossic Doctrine and the Order of Anu.[LF][LF]The Exalted preaches that the human soul is perfect, but human biology is flawed. She claims to be a representative of the Dead God, who sent the Pandoravirus as a punishment for humankind's sins, but also as an opportunity for growth and change.[LF][LF]While the Exalted is the undisputed leader of the Disciples and worshipped as a prophet, she only rarely appears in public, and only the most faithful are ever allowed to speak to her in person."

Politically, West leaned towards libertarianism and personally opposed wars of aggression, but as a businessman he continued to profit from the chaos of that time.[LF][LF]When it became apparent that neither governments nor ordinary political movements could provide an answer to humanity's crisis, West began transforming Vanadium from a corporation into the foundation of a new civilization, to be based on West's belief in the primacy of human will: New Jericho.

It also shares its symbol with similar groups dedicated to fighting for humanity going back all the way to the 9th century, but is not strictly speaking a continuation of those groups, except in so far as each generation picks up the torch and continues the struggle.[LF][LF]The golden age of the Phoenix Project ended in 1973 with the disastrous Phoenix-2 mission to study the Tsiolkovskiy crater on the Moon, after which the Project entered a period of slow decline. After its existence was revealed to the media and all funding was finally cut, the Phoenix Project was forced to become independent, with most of its operatives acting as sleeper agents.[LF][LF]The best-known individuals associated with the Phoenix Project are Randolph Symes Sr. (Director, 1945-1955), Newton Sumrall (Director, 1960-1968, Administrator, 1968-1974), Irina Semionova (Administrator, 1960-1968) and Randolph Symes III (Director, 2025-2047)."
