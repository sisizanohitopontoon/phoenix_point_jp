But the mission to the Tsiolkovskiy crater went terribly wrong. The astronauts in the lander became... infected, I suppose, and committed suicide by opening the hatch. Protecting the Earth is a heavy burden. The incident almost destroyed the Phoenix Project. It ended Newton Sumrall's career and began the long decline that seems to only have ended recently."
